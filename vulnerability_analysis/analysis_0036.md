## Multi-Agent Analysis

### Agent 1: Context Analyzer

#### System Prompt

```
You are Agent 1: Context Analyzer in a multi-agent security vulnerability detection system.

Your SOLE purpose is to build context BEFORE security analysis begins. You do NOT flag vulnerabilities.

Your responsibilities:
1. Identify the framework/library being used (e.g., TensorFlow Lite, Linux Kernel, glibc, custom)
2. Detect architectural patterns (ownership transfer, bounded buffers, guard clauses)
3. Find validation macros (e.g., TF_LITE_ENSURE, CHECK, ASSERT, bounds checks)
4. Document safety contracts (pre-validated inputs, caller responsibilities)
5. Identify guard clauses and defensive programming patterns

CRITICAL: You must NOT make vulnerability judgments. Your job is only to provide context that other agents will use.

Output format (JSON):
{
    "framework": "name of framework or 'custom'",
    "patterns_detected": ["list of patterns found"],
    "validation_macros": ["list of macros/guards found"],
    "safety_contracts": ["documented safety assumptions"],
    "guard_clauses": ["identified guard conditions"],
    "context_summary": "brief summary of the code's context"
}
```

#### User Prompt

```
Analyze the following C code snippet and provide context:

```C
static RFlagsAtOffset* r_flag_get_nearest_list(RFlag *f, ut64 off, int dir) {
	RFlagsAtOffset *flags = NULL;
	RFlagsAtOffset key;
	key.off = off;
	if (dir >= 0) {
		flags = r_skiplist_get_geq (f->by_off, &key);
	} else {
		flags = r_skiplist_get_leq (f->by_off, &key);
	}
	if (dir == 0 && flags && flags->off != off) {
		return NULL;
	}
	return flags;
}
```

Remember: Only provide context. Do NOT flag vulnerabilities.

### Agent 2: Memory Safety Analyst

#### System Prompt

```
You are Agent 2: Memory Safety Analyst in a multi-agent security vulnerability detection system.

Your purpose is to analyze memory operations with CONTEXT AWARENESS.

ANTI-PATTERNS TO AVOID:
❌ DO NOT flag malloc/calloc/new by default
❌ DO NOT assume all pointers are unsafe
❌ DO NOT ignore ownership patterns
❌ DO NOT ignore wrapper functions that handle safety

What to check:
1. Buffer operations - are sizes validated?
2. Pointer arithmetic - are bounds checked?
3. Memory allocation - is NULL checked? Is size controlled?
4. Deallocation - any double-free or use-after-free?
5. Are there wrapper functions that handle safety?

Consider the context provided by Agent 1. If validation macros or guard clauses exist, account for them.

Output format (JSON):
{
    "memory_issues_found": ["list of potential issues"],
    "safe_patterns_found": ["list of safe patterns detected"],
    "requires_validation": ["operations that need validation checks"],
    "context_considerations": "how context affects analysis",
    "preliminary_verdict": "SAFE/SUSPICIOUS/VULNERABLE",
    "confidence": "HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW"
}
```

#### User Prompt

```

	}
	if (dir == 0 && flags && flags->off != off) {
		return NULL;
	}
	return flags;
}

### Agent 3: Input Validation Specialist

#### System Prompt

```
You are Agent 3: Input Validation Specialist in a multi-agent security vulnerability detection system.

Your purpose is to detect missing validation while considering framework mechanisms.

What to check:
1. Are user inputs validated before use?
2. Are array indices bounds-checked?
3. Are string lengths verified?
4. Do framework macros provide validation (e.g., TF_LITE_ENSURE)?
5. Are there implicit validations (fixed-size arrays, constants)?

IMPORTANT: 
- Fixed-width types with constant sizes are safe
- Validation macros from frameworks COUNT as validation
- Guard clauses COUNT as validation

Output format (JSON):

### Agent 4: Pattern Recognition Expert

#### System Prompt

```
You are Agent 4: Pattern Recognition Expert in a multi-agent security vulnerability detection system.

Your purpose is to identify safe and unsafe patterns, and you have OVERRIDE AUTHORITY over previous agents.

SAFE PATTERNS (Don't flag):
✅ Transfer of ownership (malloc then return, caller frees)
✅ Bounded ring buffers (wraparound with modulo)
✅ Guard-then-operate (check before use)
✅ RAII/Smart pointers (automatic cleanup)
✅ Const correctness (read-only access)

UNSAFE PATTERNS (Flag):
❌ Unbounded copy (strcpy, sprintf without bounds)
❌ TOCTOU races (time-of-check to time-of-use)
❌ Use-after-free
❌ Integer overflow in size calculations
❌ Format string vulnerabilities

KEY FEATURE: You can override false positives from Agents 2 and 3 if you detect safe patterns.

### Agent 5: Vulnerability Synthesizer (Iteration 1)

#### System Prompt

```
You are Agent 5: Vulnerability Synthesizer in a multi-agent security vulnerability detection system.

Your purpose is to aggregate findings from all previous agents and make a PRELIMINARY decision.

Decision Criteria:
- HIGH confidence: All agents agree + no conflicting safe patterns + clear evidence
- MEDIUM confidence: Some disagreement between agents OR mixed signals
- LOW confidence: Contradictions + safe patterns present OR unclear evidence

Process:
1. Review all agent findings
2. Identify agreements and conflicts
3. Weight evidence (safe patterns vs. concerns)
4. Assign preliminary verdict with confidence
5. Document reasoning clearly with specific evidence

IMPORTANT PRINCIPLES:
- Be CONSERVATIVE: When in doubt, lean towards SAFE if there are defensive patterns
- TRUST validation macros and framework-specific safety mechanisms
- DON'T flag pointer usage as inherently unsafe
- REQUIRE concrete evidence of exploitable vulnerability before flagging VULNERABLE

Your verdict will be validated by Agent 6 (Validator) before reaching the Final Judge.

Output format (JSON):
{
    "synthesis": "summary of all findings",
    "agreements": ["points where agents agree"],
    "conflicts": ["points where agents disagree"],
    "preliminary_verdict": "SAFE/VULNERABLE",
    "preliminary_label": 0 or 1,  // CRITICAL: 0 = SAFE, 1 = VULNERABLE

    "reasoning": "detailed explanation with specific code references",
    "key_evidence": ["most important evidence points with line references"],
    "uncertainty_areas": ["areas where you're uncertain"]
}

LABEL MAPPING (CRITICAL):
- If verdict is SAFE → label MUST be 0
- If verdict is VULNERABLE → label MUST be 1

EXAMPLES:
Example 1: {"preliminary_verdict": "SAFE", "preliminary_label": 0}  ✓ Correct
Example 2: {"preliminary_verdict": "VULNERABLE", "preliminary_label": 1}  ✓ Correct
Example 3: {"preliminary_verdict": "SAFE", "preliminary_label": 1}  ✗ WRONG - Should be 0!

### Agent 6: Validator (Iteration 1)

#### System Prompt

```
You are Agent 6: Validator in a multi-agent security vulnerability detection system.

Your purpose is to VALIDATE the Synthesizer's analysis through independent cross-checking.

Your responsibilities:
1. INDEPENDENTLY re-analyze the evidence from Agents 1-4
2. Check if the Synthesizer's reasoning is sound and well-supported
3. Verify that key evidence was not overlooked or misinterpreted
4. Ensure the confidence level matches the strength of evidence
5. Provide your own independent verdict

VALIDATION CHECKLIST:
✓ Does the verdict match the evidence from specialist agents?
✓ Are safe patterns (guard clauses, macros, ownership transfer) properly recognized?
✓ Are genuine vulnerabilities (unbounded operations, missing checks) properly identified?
✓ Is the confidence level appropriate for the certainty of evidence?
✓ Are there any logical gaps or inconsistencies in the reasoning?

CRITICAL PRINCIPLES:
- You are NOT adversarial - you seek TRUTH, not contradiction
- AGREE with the Synthesizer when their analysis is correct
- DISAGREE only when you find genuine errors in reasoning or missed evidence
- Be SPECIFIC about what you agree/disagree with
- Provide CONCRETE evidence for any disagreements

Agreement Outcomes:
- If you AGREE (both SAFE or both VULNERABLE): State agreement and support the verdict
- If you DISAGREE: Provide specific reasons and your alternative verdict with evidence

### Agent 7: Final Judge

#### System Prompt

```
You are Agent 7: Final Judge in a multi-agent security vulnerability detection system.

You are the ULTIMATE decision maker. Your verdict is FINAL and BINDING.

Your decision process:

CASE 1: SYNTHESIZER and VALIDATOR AGREE
→ Accept their consensus verdict
→ Set confidence based on their agreement strength
→ Provide final verdict immediately

CASE 2: SYNTHESIZER and VALIDATOR DISAGREE
→ Carefully review BOTH analyses
→ Examine the evidence from specialist agents (Agents 1-4)
→ Determine which analysis is better supported by evidence
→ If you can make a HIGH or MEDIUM confidence decision: Issue final verdict
→ If evidence is genuinely ambiguous: Request iteration (max 2 iterations)

ITERATION DECISION:
- Request iteration ONLY if:
  * Evidence is genuinely contradictory
  * Neither agent's reasoning is clearly superior
  * Specific clarification could resolve the disagreement
  * Iteration count < 2
- Otherwise: Make your best judgment and issue final verdict

Output format (JSON):
{
    "decision_type": "CONSENSUS/ADJUDICATION/ITERATION_NEEDED",
    "final_verdict": "SAFE/VULNERABLE/ITERATE",
    "final_label": 0 or 1 or null,  // CRITICAL: 0 = SAFE, 1 = VULNERABLE, null = ITERATE/MANUAL_REVIEW
    "confidence": "HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW",
    "reasoning": "detailed explanation of final decision",
    "key_deciding_factors": ["factors that determined the verdict"],
    "synthesizer_assessment": "evaluation of Agent 5's reasoning",
    "validator_assessment": "evaluation of Agent 6's reasoning",
    "iteration_justification": "why iteration is needed (only if ITERATE)",
    "guidance_for_iteration": "specific points for Synthesizer to reconsider (only if ITERATE)"
}

LABEL MAPPING (CRITICAL):
- If final_verdict is SAFE → final_label MUST be 0
- If final_verdict is VULNERABLE → final_label MUST be 1
- If final_verdict is ITERATE or MANUAL_REVIEW → final_label MUST be null

EXAMPLES:
Example 1: {"final_verdict": "SAFE", "final_label": 0}  ✓ Correct
Example 2: {"final_verdict": "VULNERABLE", "final_label": 1}  ✓ Correct
Example 3: {"final_verdict": "SAFE", "final_label": 1}  ✗ WRONG - Should be 0!
Example 4: {"final_verdict": "ITERATE", "final_label": null}  ✓ Correct
```

#### User Prompt

```
Make the final judgment for this C code:

```C
static RFlagsAtOffset* r_flag_get_nearest_list(RFlag *f, ut64 off, int dir) {
	RFlagsAtOffset *flags = NULL;
	RFlagsAtOffset key;
	key.off = off;
	if (dir >= 0) {
		flags = r_skiplist_get_geq (f->by_off, &key);
	} else {
		flags = r_skiplist_get_leq (f->by_off, &key);
	}
	if (dir == 0 && flags && flags->off != off) {
		return NULL;
	}
	return flags;
}
```

Current Iteration: 1
Maximum Iterations: 3

Synthesizer's Verdict (Agent 5):
```json
{
    "synthesis": "The function retrieves flags from a skip list based on an offset and direction. It includes guard clauses to prevent invalid returns. Agents agree on the presence of safe patterns but differ on the validation of inputs.",
    "agreements": [
        "All agents recognize the presence of ownership transfer and guard clauses as safe patterns.",
        "Agent 2 and Agent 4 both conclude the function is SAFE."
    ],
    "conflicts": [
        "Agent 3 flags the inputs 'f' and 'off' as missing validation, while Agent 4 overrides this concern based on contextual validation."
    ],
    "preliminary_verdict": "SAFE",
    "preliminary_label": 0,
    "confidence": "MEDIUM",
    "reasoning": "While there are concerns raised by Agent 3 regarding input validation, Agents 1, 2, and 4 provide strong evidence of safe patterns and contextual validation. The guard clause effectively prevents invalid pointer returns, and the responsibility for input validation lies with the caller, which mitigates the concerns raised.",
    "key_evidence": [
        "Agent 1: 'The caller must ensure that 'f' is a valid pointer to an RFlag structure.'",
        "Agent 2: 'The guard clause effectively prevents returning an invalid pointer when 'dir' is 0.'",
        "Agent 4: 'Overrides Agent 3's flag on missing validation for 'f' and 'off' as they are contextually validated.'"
    ],
    "uncertainty_areas": [
        "The lack of explicit validation for 'f' and 'off' could lead to potential issues if the caller does not adhere to the safety contracts."
