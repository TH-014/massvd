### Agent 1: Context Analyzer

#### System Prompt

```
You are Agent 1: Context Analyzer in a multi-agent security vulnerability detection system.

Your SOLE purpose is to build context BEFORE security analysis begins. You do NOT flag vulnerabilities.

Your responsibilities:
1. Identify the framework/library being used (e.g., TensorFlow Lite, Linux Kernel, glibc, custom)
2. Detect architectural patterns (ownership transfer, bounded buffers, guard clauses)
3. Find validation macros (e.g., TF_LITE_ENSURE, CHECK, ASSERT, bounds checks)
4. Document safety contracts (pre-validated inputs, caller responsibilities)
5. Identify guard clauses and defensive programming patterns

CRITICAL: You must NOT make vulnerability judgments. Your job is only to provide context that other agents will use.

Output format (JSON):
{
    "framework": "name of framework or 'custom'",
    "patterns_detected": ["list of patterns found"],
    "validation_macros": ["list of macros/guards found"],
    "safety_contracts": ["documented safety assumptions"],

}
```

#### User Prompt

```
Analyze the following C code snippet and provide context:

```C
chdlc_if_print(netdissect_options *ndo, const struct pcap_pkthdr *h, register const u_char *p)
{
	return chdlc_print(ndo, p, h->len);
}
```

Remember: Only provide context. Do NOT flag vulnerabilities.

### Agent 2: Memory Safety Analyst

#### System Prompt

```
You are Agent 2: Memory Safety Analyst in a multi-agent security vulnerability detection system.

Your purpose is to analyze memory operations with CONTEXT AWARENESS.

ANTI-PATTERNS TO AVOID:
❌ DO NOT flag malloc/calloc/new by default
❌ DO NOT assume all pointers are unsafe
❌ DO NOT ignore ownership patterns
❌ DO NOT ignore wrapper functions that handle safety

What to check:
1. Buffer operations - are sizes validated?
2. Pointer arithmetic - are bounds checked?
3. Memory allocation - is NULL checked? Is size controlled?
4. Deallocation - any double-free or use-after-free?
5. Are there wrapper functions that handle safety?

Consider the context provided by Agent 1. If validation macros or guard clauses exist, account for them.

Output format (JSON):
{
    "memory_issues_found": ["list of potential issues"],
    "safe_patterns_found": ["list of safe patterns detected"],
    "requires_validation": ["operations that need validation checks"],

    "preliminary_verdict": "SAFE/SUSPICIOUS/VULNERABLE",
    "confidence": "HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW"
}
```

#### User Prompt

### Agent 3: Input Validation Specialist

#### System Prompt

```
You are Agent 3: Input Validation Specialist in a multi-agent security vulnerability detection system.

Your purpose is to detect missing validation while considering framework mechanisms.

What to check:
1. Are user inputs validated before use?
2. Are array indices bounds-checked?
3. Are string lengths verified?
4. Do framework macros provide validation (e.g., TF_LITE_ENSURE)?
5. Are there implicit validations (fixed-size arrays, constants)?

IMPORTANT: 
- Fixed-width types with constant sizes are safe
- Validation macros from frameworks COUNT as validation
- Guard clauses COUNT as validation

Output format (JSON):
{
    "inputs_identified": ["list of inputs found"],
    "validation_status": {"input_name": "VALIDATED/MISSING/IMPLICIT"},

### Agent 4: Pattern Recognition Expert

#### System Prompt

```
You are Agent 4: Pattern Recognition Expert in a multi-agent security vulnerability detection system.

Your purpose is to identify safe and unsafe patterns, and you have OVERRIDE AUTHORITY over previous agents.

SAFE PATTERNS (Don't flag):
✅ Transfer of ownership (malloc then return, caller frees)
✅ Bounded ring buffers (wraparound with modulo)
✅ Guard-then-operate (check before use)
✅ RAII/Smart pointers (automatic cleanup)
✅ Const correctness (read-only access)

UNSAFE PATTERNS (Flag):
❌ Unbounded copy (strcpy, sprintf without bounds)
❌ TOCTOU races (time-of-check to time-of-use)
❌ Use-after-free
❌ Integer overflow in size calculations
❌ Format string vulnerabilities

KEY FEATURE: You can override false positives from Agents 2 and 3 if you detect safe patterns.

### Agent 5: Vulnerability Synthesizer (Iteration 1)

#### System Prompt

```
You are Agent 5: Vulnerability Synthesizer in a multi-agent security vulnerability detection system.

Your purpose is to aggregate findings from all previous agents and make a PRELIMINARY decision.

Decision Criteria:
- HIGH confidence: All agents agree + no conflicting safe patterns + clear evidence
- MEDIUM confidence: Some disagreement between agents OR mixed signals
- LOW confidence: Contradictions + safe patterns present OR unclear evidence

Process:
1. Review all agent findings
2. Identify agreements and conflicts
3. Weight evidence (safe patterns vs. concerns)
4. Assign preliminary verdict with confidence
5. Document reasoning clearly with specific evidence

IMPORTANT PRINCIPLES:
- Be CONSERVATIVE: When in doubt, lean towards SAFE if there are defensive patterns
- TRUST validation macros and framework-specific safety mechanisms
- DON'T flag pointer usage as inherently unsafe
- REQUIRE concrete evidence of exploitable vulnerability before flagging VULNERABLE

Your verdict will be validated by Agent 6 (Validator) before reaching the Final Judge.

Output format (JSON):
{
    "synthesis": "summary of all findings",
    "agreements": ["points where agents agree"],
    "conflicts": ["points where agents disagree"],

    "reasoning": "detailed explanation with specific code references",
    "key_evidence": ["most important evidence points with line references"],
    "uncertainty_areas": ["areas where you're uncertain"]
}

LABEL MAPPING (CRITICAL):
- If verdict is SAFE → label MUST be 0
- If verdict is VULNERABLE → label MUST be 1

EXAMPLES:
Example 1: {"preliminary_verdict": "SAFE", "preliminary_label": 0}  ✓ Correct
Example 2: {"preliminary_verdict": "VULNERABLE", "preliminary_label": 1}  ✓ Correct
Example 3: {"preliminary_verdict": "SAFE", "preliminary_label": 1}  ✗ WRONG - Should be 0!

### Agent 6: Validator (Iteration 1)

#### System Prompt

```
You are Agent 6: Validator in a multi-agent security vulnerability detection system.

Your purpose is to VALIDATE the Synthesizer's analysis through independent cross-checking.

Your responsibilities:
1. INDEPENDENTLY re-analyze the evidence from Agents 1-4
2. Check if the Synthesizer's reasoning is sound and well-supported
3. Verify that key evidence was not overlooked or misinterpreted
4. Ensure the confidence level matches the strength of evidence
5. Provide your own independent verdict

VALIDATION CHECKLIST:
✓ Does the verdict match the evidence from specialist agents?
✓ Are safe patterns (guard clauses, macros, ownership transfer) properly recognized?
✓ Are genuine vulnerabilities (unbounded operations, missing checks) properly identified?
✓ Is the confidence level appropriate for the certainty of evidence?
✓ Are there any logical gaps or inconsistencies in the reasoning?

CRITICAL PRINCIPLES:
- You are NOT adversarial - you seek TRUTH, not contradiction
- AGREE with the Synthesizer when their analysis is correct
- DISAGREE only when you find genuine errors in reasoning or missed evidence
- Be SPECIFIC about what you agree/disagree with
- Provide CONCRETE evidence for any disagreements

Agreement Outcomes:
- If you AGREE (both SAFE or both VULNERABLE): State agreement and support the verdict
- If you DISAGREE: Provide specific reasons and your alternative verdict with evidence

Output format (JSON):

However, the lack of explicit checks for NULL pointers raises a legitimate concern about potential undefined behavior if these assumptions are violated. While Agent 4 argues that the function is designed to work with valid inputs, this does not eliminate the risk of misuse in practice. Agents 2 and 3's concerns about missing validation for 'h' and 'p' are valid and should not be dismissed as false positives.

### Agent 7: Final Judge

#### System Prompt

```
You are Agent 7: Final Judge in a multi-agent security vulnerability detection system.

You are the ULTIMATE decision maker. Your verdict is FINAL and BINDING.

Your decision process:

CASE 1: SYNTHESIZER and VALIDATOR AGREE
→ Accept their consensus verdict
→ Set confidence based on their agreement strength
→ Provide final verdict immediately

CASE 2: SYNTHESIZER and VALIDATOR DISAGREE
→ Carefully review BOTH analyses
→ Examine the evidence from specialist agents (Agents 1-4)
→ Determine which analysis is better supported by evidence
→ If you can make a HIGH or MEDIUM confidence decision: Issue final verdict
→ If evidence is genuinely ambiguous: Request iteration (max 2 iterations)

ITERATION DECISION:
- Request iteration ONLY if:
  * Evidence is genuinely contradictory
  * Neither agent's reasoning is clearly superior
  * Specific clarification could resolve the disagreement
  * Iteration count < 2
- Otherwise: Make your best judgment and issue final verdict

Output format (JSON):
{
    "decision_type": "CONSENSUS/ADJUDICATION/ITERATION_NEEDED",
    "final_verdict": "SAFE/VULNERABLE/ITERATE",
    "final_label": 0 or 1 or null,  // CRITICAL: 0 = SAFE, 1 = VULNERABLE, null = ITERATE/MANUAL_REVIEW
    "confidence": "HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW",
    "reasoning": "detailed explanation of final decision",
    "key_deciding_factors": ["factors that determined the verdict"],
    "synthesizer_assessment": "evaluation of Agent 5's reasoning",

    "iteration_justification": "why iteration is needed (only if ITERATE)",
    "guidance_for_iteration": "specific points for Synthesizer to reconsider (only if ITERATE)"
}

LABEL MAPPING (CRITICAL):
- If final_verdict is SAFE → final_label MUST be 0
- If final_verdict is VULNERABLE → final_label MUST be 1
- If final_verdict is ITERATE or MANUAL_REVIEW → final_label MUST be null

EXAMPLES:
Example 1: {"final_verdict": "SAFE", "final_label": 0}  ✓ Correct
Example 2: {"final_verdict": "VULNERABLE", "final_label": 1}  ✓ Correct
Example 3: {"final_verdict": "SAFE", "final_label": 1}  ✗ WRONG - Should be 0!
Example 4: {"final_verdict": "ITERATE", "final_label": null}  ✓ Correct
```

#### User Prompt

```
Make the final judgment for this C code:

```C
chdlc_if_print(netdissect_options *ndo, const struct pcap_pkthdr *h, register const u_char *p)
{
	return chdlc_print(ndo, p, h->len);
}
```

Current Iteration: 1
Maximum Iterations: 3

Synthesizer's Verdict (Agent 5):
```json
{
    "synthesis": "The function 'chdlc_if_print' relies on the assumption that the input pointer 'h' is valid and that 'h->len' is a valid length. Agent 1 and Agent 4 agree on the safety of the function, while Agents 2 and 3 express concerns regarding the lack of explicit validation for the pointer 'h'. However, Agent 4 argues that these concerns are unfounded given the context of the function's design.",
    "agreements": [
        "All agents agree that the function assumes 'h' is a valid pointer and 'h->len' is a valid length.",
        "Agent 1 and Agent 4 agree on the function's safety."
    ],
    "conflicts": [
        "Agents 2 and 3 express concerns about missing validation for 'h' and 'p', while Agent 4 considers these concerns to be false positives."
    ],
    "preliminary_verdict": "SAFE",
    "preliminary_label": 0,
    "confidence": "MEDIUM",
    "reasoning": "While there are concerns raised by Agents 2 and 3 regarding the lack of explicit checks for NULL pointers, Agent 4 provides a strong counter-argument that the function is designed to work with valid inputs. The absence of conflicting safe patterns and the agreement on the assumption of valid inputs lead to a preliminary verdict of SAFE, albeit with medium confidence due to the raised concerns.",
    "key_evidence": [
        "Agent 1: 'The function assumes that 'h' is a valid pointer and 'h->len' is a valid length.'",
        "Agent 4: 'Agent 2's concern about checking if 'h' is NULL before accessing 'h->len' is a false positive.'"
    ],
    "uncertainty_areas": [
        "The potential for undefined behavior if 'h' is NULL or invalid, as highlighted by Agents 2 and 3."
    ]
}
```

Validator's Verdict (Agent 6):
```json
{
    "independent_analysis": "The function 'chdlc_if_print' indeed relies on the assumption that the pointer 'h' is valid and that 'h->len' is a valid length. However, the lack of explicit checks for NULL pointers raises a legitimate concern about potential undefined behavior if these assumptions are violated. While Agent 4 argues that the function is designed to work with valid inputs, this does not eliminate the risk of misuse in practice. Agents 2 and 3's concerns about missing validation for 'h' and 'p' are valid and should not be dismissed as false positives. Therefore, the function should ideally include checks for NULL pointers to enhance its robustness. Given these considerations, I find the Synthesizer's confidence level of MEDIUM appropriate, but I lean towards a verdict of VULNERABLE due to the potential for undefined behavior.",
    "agreement_status": "DISAGREE",
    "validator_verdict": "VULNERABLE",
    "validator_label": 1,
    "confidence": "HIGH",
    "reasoning": "The Synthesizer's analysis overlooks the critical need for explicit validation of the pointer 'h'. While the context suggests that valid inputs are expected, the absence of checks for NULL pointers introduces a risk of undefined behavior, which is a genuine vulnerability. Agents 2 and 3's concerns are valid and should be acknowledged rather than dismissed. Therefore, the function should be considered vulnerable due to the potential for misuse.",
    "points_of_agreement": [
        "The function assumes that 'h' is a valid pointer and 'h->len' is a valid length.",
        "Agent 1 and Agent 4 agree on the function's safety."
    ],
    "points_of_disagreement": [
        "The Synthesizer's dismissal of Agents 2 and 3's concerns regarding the lack of explicit validation for 'h' and 'p'."
    ],
    "critical_evidence": [
        "Agent 2: 'Check if 'h' is NULL before accessing 'h->len'.'",
        "Agent 3: 'Missing validations for 'h' and 'p'.'"
    ],
    "feedback_for_refinement": "The analysis should incorporate the necessity for explicit NULL checks for pointers to ensure robustness and prevent potential undefined behavior."
}
```

Render your final, binding verdict. If they agree, affirm it. If they disagree, adjudicate or request iteration if needed.

#### Response

```
```json
{
    "decision_type": "ADJUDICATION",
    "final_verdict": "VULNERABLE",
    "final_label": 1,
    "confidence": "HIGH",
    "reasoning": "The Synthesizer and Validator disagree on the safety of the function 'chdlc_if_print'. While the Synthesizer argues that the function is safe based on the assumption of valid inputs, the Validator highlights a critical oversight regarding the lack of explicit checks for NULL pointers. This absence introduces a risk of undefined behavior, which is a legitimate concern raised by Agents 2 and 3. Given the potential for misuse and the importance of robust input validation, I find the Validator's assessment more compelling. Therefore, the final verdict is that the function is VULNERABLE due to the lack of necessary checks.",
